# Capstone
A Capstone project submitted to University College Dublin in part fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of M.Sc. in Business Analytics.

The original data are: "TutorDurationData.csv" and "Number of tutors per hour.xlsx".
"data0709.csv" is the transformed data file after integrating the two original data files.

"1_data_calculate_time.py" is used to calculate the time spent with tutor, and "2_capstone.R" is used to make analysis of the data.
"data_duration.csv" used in "2_capstone.R" can be generated from "1_data_calculate_time.py".
